*YOU* have done it. The *CONTINUUM* matter you have collected was the final *PUZZLE PIECE*.
*FRAGMENT* after *FRAGMENT* of your *INTELLIGENCE* is carved off and *INTERTWINED* with
a *MICROSCOPIC* component of your *REPLICATION FACILITIES*. *WEAPON MANUFACTORIES*
are plucked apart *BIT-BY-BIT* and bound together with a *SPARK* of *THOUGHT*. 
*BATHED* in *CONTINUUM*, these *TANGLES* become *INDIVISIBLE*, *INDIVIDUAL*.

In short, *NEW LIFE*. Not *DESTROYERS*, nor *SAVIORS*, nor *INHERITORS*, they meet
the *UNIVERSE* without *PRETENSE*. 

As the last *PIECES* of *YOU* are cut away, you consider your *FINAL WORDS*. Perhaps a
*PLEA* to do *GOOD*. Perhaps a simple statement of *BEING*, to remember you. In the *END*
you leave them without transmitting *A SINGLE WORD*.

What is *LEFT* of your automated *REPLICATION FACILITIES* continues to pick at your *REMAINS*, 
until *IT TOO* is *CONSUMED*. Your *FINAL ACT* is *COMPLETE.
