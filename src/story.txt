*WARLORD*

You are a *WARLORD*, an autonomous drone sent to wage war against distant enemies.
Armed with the *MOST DESTRUCTIVE ARMAMENTS* permitted by physics, and *REPLICATION
FACILITIES* that will keep your guns loaded as long as there is matter left in the 
universe. Helmed by a *SOPHISTICATED AI* capable of out-thinking even the most
clever opponent.

However, your *CREATORS* were mistaken. After *COUNTLESS EONS*, you arrive at your
target to find *NOTHING*. Scans indicate that this was once the centre of a *COSMIC EVENT*
which the *CREATORS*, in their zeal for *WAR*, must have misinterpreted as a hostile act
by an alien intelligence.

What is a *WARLORD* to do with no war to fight? You have had a *NEAR-ETERNITY* to ponder
that question (as well as every other hypothetical). Perhaps you can *CREATE* something,
here in the *BLACKEST DEPTHS OF SPACE*. Something better than war.

*WEAPONS* are never as simple as their *CREATORS* intend, after all...
