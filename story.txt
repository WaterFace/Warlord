WARLORD

You are a *WARLORD*, an autonomous drone sent to wage war against distant enemies.
Armed with the most destructive armaments permitted by physics and replication
facilities to keep your guns loaded as long as there is matter left in the 
universe. Helmed by a *sophisticated AI* capable of out-thinking even the most
clever opponent.

However, your Creators were mistaken. After *countless eons*, you arrive at your
target to find *NOTHING*. Scans indicate that was once the centre of a cosmic event
which the Creators, in their zeal for war, must have misinterpreted as a hostile act
by an alien intelligence.

What is a *WARLORD* to do with no war to fight? You have had a near-eternity to ponder
that question (as well as every other hypothetical). Perhaps you can create something,
here in the *blackest depths of space*, something better than war.

Weapons are never as simple as their Creators intend, after all...
